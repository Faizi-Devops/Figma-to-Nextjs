                                Well, there are no B2B marketplaces anywhere that deal with: limited/ hyped goods, or a marketplace where stores (with no brand account) & reseller could buy from (in bulk prices footwear, apparel, accessories) without any boundaries or questions! So let's try and create that platform: so other store owners & resellers/wholesalers worldwide could profit from!</p>

                        <p className={styles.sixthparag}>Stores are flooded with quantities of the same items, so what do they <br /> do? They flip them on well known resell platform/marketplace; and we <br /> are all very familiar with these marketplaces... . How can you sell some <br /> Yeezys or Nike, when buyers/bidders are offering a price of 20-35% under <br /> retail? Simple, if you are not the store yourself or a person who bought <br /> them at roughly 35% to 40% off retail... then forget it!</p>
                        <p className={styles.sixthbold}>So, as a store owner, we see 3 options :</p>
                        <p className={styles.sixthparag}>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Sell all your sleeping inventory on certain platforms one by one etc. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (and for sure , some models will not even sell ...so it’s a loss).Shipping <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will take a while, and you are wasting time & labor...</p>
